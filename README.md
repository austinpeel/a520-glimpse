Mass maps reconstructed with the [Glimpse](https://github.com/CosmoStat/Glimpse) sparsity-based mass mapping software on ground-based (left) and space-based (right) telescope data. The projected matter distributions (dark + luminous) are in color and overlaid on the science image.

Source galaxy density maps from Clowe et al. 2012 (C12, left) and Jee et al. 2014 (J14, right) data sets. The C12 galaxy ellipticity catalog was derived from a combination of Magellan and HST/ACS images with galaxy number densities of 22 and 56 per square arcmin, respectively. The J14 catalog comes from the same ACS data as C12, but it exhibits a higher galaxy number density of 109 per square arcmin due to a different reduction pipeline.
